This is a fork of btree_gin extension. The original project is located at
https://git.postgresql.org/git/postgresql.git, contrib/btree_gin directory.

In this fork, support for uuid columns is added for btree_gin for PostgreSQL
9.5 and 10. Although the extension has the same version (1.3) as in the
upstream master branch, this extension is not fully compatible with the
upstream extension: only support for uuid has been added to the fork.

example:

postgresql-server-dev-9.5

2. In the project root directory execute:
